            "This resume has a good foundation but needs significant improvements to be competitive for software engineering or data science roles.  Here's a detailed breakdown of suggestions:\n",
            "\n",
            "**1. Structure & Formatting:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Contact Information:**  Good.  Consider adding LinkedIn profile URL.\n",
            "* **Summary:** Too generic.  Instead of a summary, use a **Professional Profile** or **Objective** statement.  This should be tailored to the specific job being applied for, highlighting 1-2 key accomplishments and relevant skills.  For example:  \"Results-oriented Software Engineer with 2+ years of experience building and deploying scalable web applications using Flask, React, and PostgreSQL. Proven ability to deliver high-quality code within agile development environments, contributing to significant improvements in [mention a quantifiable achievement, e.g., system performance or user engagement].\"\n",
            "* **Experience:** Needs expansion.  Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to describe accomplishments.  Quantify results whenever possible (e.g., \"Improved API response time by 15%\"). Bullet points should be action-oriented and start with strong verbs. Instead of \"Built REST APIs...\", try \"Developed and deployed high-performance REST APIs using Flask and PostgreSQL, resulting in a 20% increase in data processing efficiency.\"\n",
            "* **Education:**  Fine for now, but consider adding GPA if above 3.5, relevant coursework (e.g., Machine Learning, Data Structures and Algorithms), or academic projects.\n",
            "* **Skills:** Needs organization and expansion.  Group skills into categories (e.g., Programming Languages, Databases, Frameworks, Tools, Cloud Platforms).  Add more specific skills based on the target job description.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Skills (Missing or Outdated):**\n",
            "\n",
            "The skills listed are a good starting point, but lack depth and breadth.  Depending on the target role (Software Engineer vs. Data Scientist), the following additions are crucial:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Software Engineering:**  Consider adding skills like:\n",
            "    * **Testing Frameworks:**  JUnit, pytest, Selenium\n",
            "    * **Version Control (beyond Git):**  GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket workflows (e.g., branching strategies, pull requests)\n",
            "    * **Cloud Platforms:** AWS, Azure, GCP (at least familiarity with one)\n",
            "    * **Agile Methodologies:** Scrum, Kanban\n",
            "    * **Design Patterns:**  Familiarity with common design patterns\n",
            "    * **Specific libraries/tools:** Depending on the role, add libraries used for specific tasks (e.g., logging libraries, message queues)\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Data Science:** If aiming for a data science role, the skills need a significant overhaul:\n",
            "    * **Programming Languages:** R (in addition to Python)\n",
            "    * **Data Manipulation/Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn\n",
            "    * **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, Power BI\n",
            "    * **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Regression, Classification, Clustering\n",
            "    * **Big Data Technologies:** Spark, Hadoop (depending on the role)\n",
            "    * **Databases (beyond SQL):** NoSQL databases like MongoDB or Cassandra\n",

To target a Data Science role, significant changes are needed, focusing on data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning skills.
